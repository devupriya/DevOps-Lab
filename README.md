# Day 1 â€“ EC2 + Linux Setup

## What I did:
- Created an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2)
- SSH'd into it using .pem key
- Installed and started NGINX
- Verified web server is working via public IP

## Screenshots / Commands:
- `ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@x.x.x.x`
- `sudo yum install nginx -y`

## Reflections:
- First time connecting to a remote Linux server.
- Got more comfortable with the terminal.
- Ready to build on this tomorrow.
